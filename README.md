# Travel Tracker

The Travel Tracker project is the final solo project for Front End Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. The idea behind the project was to build an application in which a user can select flights based on multiple destinations if they are a traveler, or view all users qualities as a travel agent. The main goals of this project were to structure code progression based around Test Driven Design, implement a class based structure, and have functions and methods utilize a Singular Responsibility Principal.
